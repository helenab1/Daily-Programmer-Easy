/* The program should take three arguments. 
The first will be a day, the second will be month, 
and the third will be year. 
Then, your program should compute the day of the week 
that date will fall on.

1700–1799     4
1800–1899     2
1900–1999     0
2000–2099     6
2100–2199     4
2200–2299     2
2300–2399     0
2400–2499     6
2500–2599     4
2600–2699     2
You can clearly see the pattern “6 4 2 0”

Here’s the month table.

Month		Common  	Leap
January 	0  		6
February	3 		2
March		3		3
April		6		6
May			1		1
June		4		4
July		6		6
August  	2		2
September	5		5
October 	0		0
November	3		3
December	5		5
Columns 2 and 3 differs only for January and February.

Clearly the day table is as follows.

Sunday  	0
Monday  	1
Tuesday 	2
Wednesday	3
Thursday	4
Friday  	5
Saturday	6
Now let’s go back to the algorithm.

Using these tables and applying a simple formula we can calculate what day was on some given date. Here are the steps of this algorithm.

Get the number for the corresponding century from the centuries table;
Get the last two digits from the year;
Divide the number from step 2 by 4 and get it without the remainder;
Get the month number from the month table;
Sum the numbers from steps 1 to 4 AND add in the month day (18 as in 6/18/89);
Divide it by 7 and take the remainder;
Find the result of step 6 in the days table;
